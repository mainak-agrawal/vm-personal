# Alternative Deployment Methods for Your Next.js App

Since `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` is having issues on Windows, here are alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Deploy via Cloudflare Pages Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Go to Cloudflare Dashboard** → Pages → Create a project
3. **Connect to Git** → Select your repository
4. **Build Settings**:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output directory: `.next`
   - Root directory: `/` (leave empty)
   - Environment variables: Add your R2 credentials

## Option 2: Use Cloudflare Pages CLI

```bash
# Deploy the built files directly
wrangler pages deploy .next --project-name vm-personal-website
```

## Option 3: Static Site Generation (Limited functionality)

If you don't need server-side features, you can convert to static:

1. Update `next.config.ts`:
```typescript
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: { unoptimized: true }
}
```

2. Add `generateStaticParams` to your dynamic routes
3. Build and deploy: `npm run build && wrangler pages deploy out`

## Option 4: Install Node.js in WSL

```bash
# In WSL
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
cd /mnt/c/Users/maiagrawal/personal-projects/vm-personal
npm install
npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages
```

## Current Status

Your app is built and ready. The issue is with the `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` conversion step on Windows.

**Recommended next steps:**
1. Try Option 1 (Cloudflare Pages Dashboard) - easiest
2. Or use Option 4 (WSL with Node.js) for full functionality
